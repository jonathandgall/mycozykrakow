# My Cozy Krakow

My Cozy Krakow is my Udacity graduation project. Creating a full responsive web application from scratch, using at least three apis integration, including the Google Map one.


The initial environement was setup through Yeoman. Gulp is being used as an automation build system in this project.

In order to launch this application locally, please follow those three steps:

1. Download or clone this repository
2. In terminal, cd under directory and type 'gulp serve'
3. Launch your browser to the url localhost:9000

In order to test the web performance of the application, another step is needed.
When launching the application, you will see in the terminal an url following this pattern:

 -------------------------------------
https://907f1e7a.ngrok.io
 -------------------------------------

 Please enter the url between the two lines of dash to test a web-hosted version of the application.
